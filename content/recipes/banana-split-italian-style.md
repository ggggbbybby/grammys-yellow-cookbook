_Here's a banana slplit to top all banana splits. No drug store in memory ever served anything quite like this one._
_It's a scrumptious combination of bananas, three kinds of ice cream and a warm sabaglione sauce fragrent with Amaretto, Italy's intriguing liqueur that's making quite a name for itself in this country._

* 6 egg yolks
* 3 tbsp sugar
* 6 tbsp Amaretto
* 6 large bananas
* 1 pint each strawberry, vanilla, and pistachio ice cream
* Whipped cream, cherries, sliced almonds

1. In the top part of a double boiler, mix egg yolks, surag, and Amaretto. Place mixture over hot simmering (not boiling) water and beat with an electric mixer until very thick and creamy, about 7 minutes. Remove from heat and continue beating until mixture is just warm.
2. Peel bananas and slice lengthwise and plate in serving dishes. 
3. Top each banana with 3 scoops of ice cream - strawberry, vanilla, and pistachio.
4. Spoon warm amaretto mixture over ice cream. Top with whipped cream, cherries and almonds.
