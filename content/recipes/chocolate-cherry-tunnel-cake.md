_Chocolate Cake_
* 6 oz miniature semisweet chocolate chips
* 1/4 cup milk
* 1 box fudge cake mix
* 1 cup water
* 3 eggs, at room temp
* 1/2 cup butter milk, at room temp
* 2 tbsp unsalted butter, softened
* 2 tbsp vegetable oail
* 1/2 to 3/4 cup cherry brandy

_Cherry Filling_
* 2 cup fresh cherries, pitted and coarsely chopped
* 5 tbsp cherry brandy
* 2 tsp cornstarch
* 1 tsp vanilla extract

_Assembly_
* 3/4 cup heavy whipping cream
* 1 tbsp confectioners sugar
* 1 tbsp cherry brandy
* 5 whole cherries, with stems
* Grated chocolate

1. Bring the milk to a gentle boil. Pour hot milk over chocolate chips and whisk until smooth.
2. Combine cake mix, water, eggs, buttermilk, butter, oil, and melted chocolate. Mix at medium speed for 1 minute, or until all ingredients are moistened. Increase to high speed and beat 2 minutes until the batter is thick and smooth.
3. Scrape the batter into a buttered and floured 9-inch / 14 cup tube pan. Smooth the top with a rubber spatula.
4. Bake at 350 for 40-50 minutes or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out with a few moist crumbs.
5. Cool in pan on a wire rack for 20 minutes. Run a  knife around the top edge of the cake and invert onto a wire rack to cool completely.
6. Using a small sharp knife, cut a trench about 1 1/2" deep, 3/4" wide through the top center of the cake. Holding the knife sideways, lift out the trench, piece by piece and reserve.
7. In a small saucepan, heat the brandy until it is very warm but not boiling. Brush the cake with the warm brandy, allowing the cake to soak it up between applications.
6. Mix 4 tbsp brandy, cornstarch, and vanilla. Stir mixture and chopped cherries in a small saucepan and heat over medium heat for 5 minutes, stirring constantly, until the mixture has come to a boil and thickened. Remove the saucepan from heat and stir in remaining 1 tbsp of brandy. Refrigerate.
8. Beat whipped cream, sugar, and brandy until soft peaks start to form. 
9. Spoon the cherry filling into the trench in the cake, filling evenly. Fill a pastry bag fitted with a start tip with the whipped cream. Pipe a decorative pattern over the cherry filled trench.
10. If desired, place five whole cherries, evenly spaced, on the whipped cream. Sprinkle with chocolate shavings.
