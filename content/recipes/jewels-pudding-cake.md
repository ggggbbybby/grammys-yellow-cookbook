_or That Sinfully Rich Dessert with White Chocolate and Macadamia Nuts_

* 1 cup flour
* Â½ cup butter, softened
* 1 cup finely chopped nuts
* 8 oz cream cheese, softened
* 1 cup sugar
* 9 oz frozen whipped topping - divided in half
* 1 package (large) instant chocolate pudding mix
* 1 package (large) instant vanilla pudding mix
* 3 cups cold milk

1. Mix flour, butter, and nuts together until finely crumbled. Press into a 9x13" greased dish or pan.
2. Bake crust at 350 degrees 15-20 minutes. Cool.
3. Beat cream cheese and sugar until smooth. Fold in half of the whipped topping. Spread over cooled crust. 
4. Mix puddings together, and beat with milk until smooth and thick. Spread over cream cheese layer.
5. Top with remaining whipped topping and crate white chocolate over the top for garnish. Refrigerate overnight.

Note from Patsy: I used 1 cup finely chopped macadamia nuts in the crust. I omitted the whipped topping on top and instead sprinkled with a layer of chopped white chocolate bits.
