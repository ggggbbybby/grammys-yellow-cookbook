_This dish was named for a lovely young lady who found apricots treated in this refreshing Louisiana way especially appealing._

* 3 tbsp butter
* ¼ cup firmly packed light brown sugar
* 1 pound fresh apricots (about 1 dozen) peeled, halved, and pitted
* ¼ cup light rum
* 1 quart vanilla ice cream

1. In an attractive 12 inch skillet over medium heat, melt butter. Add sugar and cook, stirring until bubbly.
2. Add apricot halves in a single layer ond cook, turning once, about 3 minutes.
3. Pour rum over hot apricots, ignite and let the flames die down.
4. Serve at once over ice cream.

Note: to peel apricots, cover generously with boiling water and let stand off heat until skins can be slipped off.
